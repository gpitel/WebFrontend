# Frontend test architecture

Playwright suite for OpenMagnetics WebFrontend. Runs against the live dev
server (`BASE_URL`, default `http://localhost:5173`). Headless only, always.

## Non-negotiables

- **Headless only.** Never `headless: false`, `--headed`, `PWDEBUG=1`,
  `PWHEADED=1`, `HEADED=1`, `devtools:true`, `slowMo`. Three layers enforce
  this (`use.headless`, `launchOptions.headless`, `--headless=new`), plus
  `assertHeadlessEnv()` runs at config load, plus `tests/lint-tests.js`
  rules `no-headless-false`, `no-headed-flag`, `no-pwdebug`,
  `no-devtools-true`, `no-slowmo`.
- **No silent fallbacks.** Throw loudly when a precondition is missing.
  `value_or(...)`, `.catch(() => 0)`, "return false on missing UI" all hide
  real bugs. See CLAUDE.md "No fallbacks, no defaults, no silent shortcuts".
- **No hardcoded localhost ports.** Use `BASE_URL` from
  `tests/utils/env.js` or Playwright's `baseURL` config. Lint enforces.
- **`waitForTimeout` lives only in `tests/utils/wait.js`.** Everywhere else,
  use a real signal (`waitForFunction`, `waitForSelector`, `waitForResponse`).

Run `npm run test:lint` to see current violations; `npm run test:lint:ci`
to gate CI.

```

## Adding a new wizard to the suite

1. Append one entry to `tests/utils/catalog.js` with `key`, `linkCy`,
   `wizardPrefix`, `topology`, `tags`, `capabilities` (adviser/coreAdviser/
   wireAdviser/simulated/iKnowMode).
2. Create `tests/wizards/<key>.spec.js`:
   ```js
   import { makeBatterySpec, getWizard } from '../utils/index.js';
   makeBatterySpec(getWizard('<key>'));
   ```
   This generates Groups A/B/D/E/F/G automatically (gated by capability flags).
3. If the wizard needs a pre-condition (e.g. picking a radio before
   analytical), add it to the catalog entry as a `precondition(page)` hook —
   never fork the battery file.

The parameterized `tests/scenarios/_all-wizards.spec.js` will pick up the
new entry on its next run; no edits needed there.

## Writing a new scenario / step

- **Step** (one verb on the magnetic tool, e.g. "open the coil exports
  modal and download the SVG"): add to `tests/utils/steps.js`, wrap in
  `test.step('myStep', async () => …)`, throw on missing UI.
- **Scenario** (composition of steps producing a structural result, e.g.
  "full magnetic via Magnetic Adviser"): add to `tests/utils/scenarios.js`,
  return a result object the caller can assert against.
- **Assertion** (domain check on a returned object, e.g. "this SVG fits"):
  add to `tests/utils/assertions.js`. Use Playwright's `expect()` so it
  integrates with the HTML report.

## Projects

`playwright.config.js` defines five projects with tag-based selection:

| project       | matches                                          | parallel target |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| smoke         | `tests/wizards/**` tagged `@smoke` (fast battery, <60s) | high      |
| site          | home, settings, ui-regressions, new-wizards-smoke | high            |
| wizards-light | per-topology battery files (non-WASM tests only)  | high            |
| scenarios     | `tests/scenarios/**`, `tests/wizards/**` minus @heavy | medium      |
| heavy         | DAB battery + anything tagged `@heavy`            | serial          |

Run one project: `npx playwright test --project=scenarios`.

Tags (apply via `test.describe('… @smoke @scenario @heavy', …)`):
- `@smoke`     — minimal "does it boot" tests
- `@scenario`  — anything in `tests/scenarios/` or `tests/wizards/`
- `@heavy`     — long WASM runs (DAB high-power, big CMC sweeps)
- `@layout`    — pure DOM/CSS assertions, no WASM
- `@numerical` — numerical agreement assertions (analytical vs simulated)
- `@nightly`   — slow tests that only run nightly in CI

Currently `workers: 1` and `fullyParallel: false` until per-worker storage
state is end-to-end validated (Phase 9 acceptance criterion).

## Cold vs. warm fixture

| | Cold (`test`) | Warm (`warmTest`) |
|---|---|---|
| Import | `import { test } from './_coverage.js'` | `import { warmTest as test, resetStoresWarm } from './_coverage.js'` |
| Page scope | Per test | Per worker |
| WASM re-init | Every test (~3–5 s) | Once per worker |
| State isolation | Fresh browser context | Caller must `resetStoresWarm(sharedPage)` |
| When to use | Default | ≥3 tests in one file all bootstrap the same tool/wizard |

Today only `warm-demo.spec.js` uses warm. Phase 9 will roll warm out to
layout-only tests under the `site` and `wizards-light` projects.

Warm rules:
1. Clean up — close modals, dismiss dropdowns, return to a known route.
2. Reset Pinia at the start: `await resetStoresWarm(sharedPage)`.
3. Don't `sharedPage.goto()`. Use SPA navigation via `$router.push`.
4. If a test can't be made idempotent, keep it cold.

## Coverage mode

`COVERAGE=1 npm run test:coverage` flips `_coverage.js` into V8 mode and
emits an HTML report to `test-results/coverage/index.html` via
monocart-reporter. Works in both cold and warm; warm attributes coverage
to the worker page rather than per-test, which is a known limitation.

## Skipping a test

**Phase 11: banned.** `test.skip(...)` and `test.fixme(...)` are forbidden
in `*.spec.js`. The lint rule `no-test-skip` (`lint-tests.js:104`) enforces.
Convert any "we don't have the data yet" / "this is flaky" precondition
into an explicit `expect()` or `throw` so failures surface loudly.

The legacy `tests/_skips.json` allowlist from Phase 6 no longer exists.

## Console-error policy

Tests assert "no unexpected console errors" via:

```js
import { collectConsoleErrors, expectNoConsoleErrors } from './utils/index.js';
const errs = collectConsoleErrors(page);
// ... run test ...
expectNoConsoleErrors(errs);
```

`utils/console.js#KNOWN_NOISE` is a NARROW allowlist of patterns we have
decided to live with (browser quirks, dev-server connection failures in
offline tests, known WASM stderr lines tracked in MKF#TBD). Prefer fixing
the source over expanding this list.

## Migration / refactor status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 0  Lint script + baseline doc          | ✅ landed |
| 1  utils/ package + per-worker setup   | ✅ landed |
| 2  Scenario library (steps/scenarios/assertions/catalog) | ✅ landed |
| 3  Parameterized loop spec             | ✅ `tests/scenarios/_all-wizards.spec.js` |
| 4  `makeBatterySpec` template          | ✅ `tests/utils/battery.js` + `tests/wizards/*.spec.js` |
| 5  waitForTimeout / silent-catch sweep | ⏸  needs dev server validation first |
| 6  Skip triage                         | ✅ `_skips.json` allowlist + lint integration |
| 7  Orphan repro deletion               | ✅ 7 files removed |
| 8  WASM console contract               | ⏸  cross-repo (MKF) — not started |
| 9  4-project config                    | ✅ `playwright.config.js` projects[] |
| 10 TESTS.md rewrite                    | ✅ this file |

Phases 5 + 8 + the parallel-workers flip in Phase 9 are gated on running
the new scenario library end-to-end against the dev server. Until that
happens, the legacy `*-battery.spec.js` files remain authoritative.
