"""OpenMagnetics MCP App server — magnetic component design in a chat.

Exposes the OpenMagnetics engine (through the ``PyOpenMagnetics`` pybind11
module) as MCP tools, with sweep charts as an MCP Apps UI resource (SEP-1865).

Companion to the Kirchhoff server: Kirchhoff emits a magnetic's MAS Inputs
(``magnetic_inputs``), this server advises real core+coil designs for them, and
the chosen MAS goes back to Kirchhoff's ``bind_part``. The model brokers the
handoff across the two connectors — replacing the cross-origin postMessage
round-trip the web apps use, which exists only because a browser cannot run
this engine.

Run:
    python3 mcp/server.py                # streamable HTTP on 127.0.0.1:8402/mcp

    OPENMAGNETICS_MCP_PORT=8409 python3 mcp/server.py     # alongside Kelvin,
